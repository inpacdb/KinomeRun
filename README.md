# KinomeRun

# KinomeRun: An interactive utility for kinome target screening and interaction fingerprint analysis towards holistic visualization on kinome tree 

KinomeRun is a python based GUI pipeline which can be used for performing the target screening with the ligand of interest. It can be used to perform inverse screening against the kinome structures. KinomeRun integrates AutoDock Vina for performing the virtual screening and Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler for calculation of the kinome-ligand interaction patterns at Largescale. The customized filteration analysis using KinomeRun will enable the user to specify the interaction filteraction pattern of their own for target prioritization and ranking for visualization in the Kinometree produced by KinomeRender.


***Software Required to run KinomeRun:**
    + GNU Parallel (https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
    + Autodock Vina (http://vina.scripps.edu/)
    + KinomeRender (http://biophys.umontreal.ca/nrg/resources.html)
    + Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) (https://github.com/ssalentin/plip)
    + Kinome Dataset

***KinomeRun Installation:**
    + Just unzip and run the python scripts provided directly to run the program. 

Video tutorial for installation, virtual screening and cutomized filteration of KinomeRun is available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuIaEFtMVgQ7v__WigQH9ilGVxrfI1LKs

Alternatively, the video tutorial can be downloaded from the following link for offline visualization: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PaQHKDnyVDmXcWSXzeJQGgwEZkPhgOAs   (For the benefit of users to whom the youtube is not accessible)
